                      <td>Every year, new students enter the institute and old students bid farewell. An institutionâ€™s network is widespread in terms on numerous alumni spread across different cities and countries. Connections with all the alumni over the years is difficult to maintain unless the institute involves itself into keeping in touch and engaging their alumni. Golden Jubilee is one of the occasions where an institution celebrates its establishment with their oldest alumni. 50 years is a long duration! The alumni attending this reunion have different thoughts, ideologies and discipline. Golden Jubilee is a good occasion for alumni to learn what their oldest alumni underwent while graduating and how did young alumni pursue their college and career.</td>
